Your first step is to create a resource group for the virtual machine to live in. This will decide the global region that your cloud server will reside in and you can organize it with a name.

After creating an Azure account, sign in and you will be taken to the Azure home screen/dashboard. Here you'll find common Azure services and a search bar at the top. Click on 'Resource groups' or type it into the search bar to be able to click it.
